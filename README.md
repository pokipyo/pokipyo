Hello, I'm @pokipyo (they/them).

My interests include web development, cybersecurity, cryptocurrency, and machine learning.
I am currently enrolled in "The Web Developer Bootcamp" on Udemy, taught by Colt Steele to give myself something to do, 
but I will be attending an online computer science program in Spring 2025.
